# Mountain Bikes Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

## üìå Project Overview:
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Mountain Bikes sales performance. It showcases key metrics like revenue, profit margin, order volume, and return rates, along with visual breakdowns by product categories and sales trends over time.

## üîç Key Insights

1. Total Revenue: $24.91M
This figure represents the overall sales generated from mountain bike products over the selected time period. A revenue of nearly $25 million indicates a healthy business with strong customer demand and successful product strategies.

2. Profit Margin: $10.46M
The profit margin highlights how much of the total revenue remains after deducting costs. With a profit of $10.46M, the business is operating efficiently and earning a solid return on sales. The average product profit margin (44.26%) shown in the product table supports this strength.

3. Total Orders: 25K
This metric reflects the volume of customer transactions. A total of 25,000 orders shows a strong customer base and steady demand across categories, particularly in Accessories and Bikes, as seen in the category-wise order chart.

4. Return Rate: 2.17%
A low return rate indicates high customer satisfaction and low product issues. At 2.17%, this rate suggests that most buyers are happy with their purchases and that the logistics, quality control, and product descriptions are effective.
